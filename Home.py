Letâ€™s follow along meteorites
â€”yes, those celestial wanderersâ€”
as they make their appearances into our world.
 
In the vast cosmic tapestry, meteorites are but tiny threads,
remnants of our primordial solar neighborhood.
 
Like cosmic messengers, they travel vast distances
to bring whispers of our distant past.
 
We'll take you on a sonic voyage through time,
from more than five hundred years ago 
to the present day.
